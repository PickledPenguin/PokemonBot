const HELP_POKEMON = `
Welcome to the Pokemon game! For a full list of all commands, type "!help-commands".
(First time? Type "!register" to join the game.)

Catch fellow players by posting a picture of them in the POKEMON channel and using "!catch" with their mention (@Username). If multiple players are in one picture, mention them all to catch everyone. Points are awarded based on the rarity of the person you catch. Everyone's rarity increases every day that they are not caught, earning roles like UNCOMMON, RARE, and SHINY.

You can also catch "Pok√©mon-like" animals (or statues) by using "!catch" with "@barnaby" as the mention. You can send up to ${process.env.BARNABY_ATTACHMENT_LIMIT} unique pictures per message and will recieve points for each one. No duplicate pictures are allowed!

After a catch, both you and the person caught will be on a ${process.env.COOLDOWN_MINUTES}-minute cooldown, preventing further catches between you two during that time.

Each week, top players earn special PERKS. Type "!help-perks" to learn more! Use "!status @username" to check a player's status or "!leaderboard" for the overall top 10 players.

Finally, after a "!catch", you'll receive a fun AI-generated message based on your AI-personality and that of the person you caught! The default personality is "Pokemon Announcer," but you can change it with "!set-personality" and get creative!
